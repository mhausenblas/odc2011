## Directory structure

### Stuff in /setup

This directory contains stuff for preparing data, setting up the
database, and importing the initial data.

clean-applications.rb
  Reads the LGCSB GPlan_Metadata.txt file, does various bits of cleaning,
  drops some columns that we don't need, and writes a deduplicated CSV
  file to stdout.

  Both the original GPlan_Metadata.txt file, and the cleaned
  applications.csv, are on @mhausenblas' dropbox.

schema.sql
  The database schema, including data for some of the small 
  auxiliary tables.

import-lgcsb-applications.sql
  A SQL script that imports the LGCSB application dump. Input
  is the cleaned CSV file derived from the original
  GPlan_Metadata.txt. It must be called applications.csv and
  be in the current directory.

initial_tweeting.php
  Populates the Twitter accounts with a few tweets. This should
  never be run again!


### Stuff in /jobs

This directory contains maintenance and update jobs that should be run
periodically via cron.

import_fingal_csv.php
  Import the CSV dump from data.fingal.ie

import_scraperwiki.php
  Import the latest updates from ScraperWiki. If run with --initial
  argument, it imports everything from the ScraperWiki data store.
  This should be once as part of the application setup.

send_tweets.php
  Send tweets for recently imported new applications
